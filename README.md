# Titanic Machine Learning

### Kaggle Competition - Classification

This is a jupyter notebook with a python code using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Here you can see around 10 models and the whole code, now it is possible to make some adjustments in order to get the perfect prediction.

Also, check out all the libraries I have used in this project.

Hope you enjoy! Thank you!
