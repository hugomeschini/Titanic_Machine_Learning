# Titanic Machine Learning

### Kaggle Competition

This is a jupyter notebook with a python code using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Here you can see around 10 models and the whole code, now it is possible to make some adjustments in order to get the perfect prediction.

Hope you enjoy! Thank you!
